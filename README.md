## 💼 Career Journey  
My IT journey began in 2007, when computers were less common. I started by studying for an IT degree, which gave me a strong foundation in tech fundamentals. 

I then had the opportunity to work at the first Apple Store in Marbella, Málaga, Spain, gaining firsthand experience in sales, tech support, and customer service within a rapidly evolving industry.

Following that, I embarked on a journey around the world, working in training and sales across IT, sports, and languages—my three passions.
