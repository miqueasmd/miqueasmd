# 🚀 About Me  💻 IT Technical Trainer (EN/ES/FR)
## 🎓 AI Agents | Cloud & Automation (RPA) Engineer

I'm a data enthusiast with a diverse IT, training, and sales background, currently sharpening my  skills in Cloud Engineering, AI Agents & Automations.

With experience as a bilingual technical trainer, I combine analytical problem-solving with a strong passion for training and mentoring others.

## 💼 Career Journey  
My IT journey began in 2007, when computers and smartphones were less common. I started by studying for an IT degree, which gave me a strong foundation in tech fundamentals. 

Then, I had the opportunity to work at the first Apple Store in Marbella, Málaga, Spain, gaining firsthand experience in sales, tech support, and customer service within a rapidly evolving industry.

Following that, I embarked on a journey around the world (USA, UK, Germany and Spain), working in training and sales across IT, sports, and languages—my three passions. 

## 💡 Current Focus
I specialize in helping businesses and professionals boost their skills and companies with Cloud, Automation, and AI.

## 🌍 Language Proficiency 
Fluent in Spanish (Native), English (Proficient), French (B2 and learning) and Sign Language (Intermediate).
