# 🚀 About Me
## 🎓 Data Analysis | IT, Training & Sales

I'm a data enthusiast with a diverse IT, training, and sales background, currently sharpening my data analysis and machine learning skills.

With experience as a bilingual technical trainer, I combine analytical problem-solving with a strong passion for training and mentoring others.

## 💼 Career Journey  
My IT journey began in 2007, when computers and smartphones were less common. I started by studying for an IT degree, which gave me a strong foundation in tech fundamentals. 

Then, I had the opportunity to work at the first Apple Store in Marbella, Málaga, Spain, gaining firsthand experience in sales, tech support, and customer service within a rapidly evolving industry.

Following that, I embarked on a journey around the world (USA, UK, Germany and Spain), working in training and sales across IT, sports, and languages—my three passions. 

## 💡 Current Focus
Data Analysis with a focus on Python, SQL, and machine learning applications, aiming to work in the fields of **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning**.

## 🌍 Language Proficiency 
Fluent in Spanish (Native), English (Proficient), French (B1 and learning) and Sign Language (Intermediate).
